                        <strong>My Beloved, kwanâ™¡</strong>
                        <p>
                          <p>
To you, i took a walk inside my heart .
<br>
A walk through a meadow of word.
<br>
To love so pure, purely to ward off woe.
<br>
I picked, and placed in my basket.
<br>
<br>
thanks to  the universe for meeting you,
<br>
The stars too for experiencing you
<br>
Beneath a rainbow of words
<br>
When i got home(still in my heart) .
<br>
and i would poured all of my flower of loved ok your vase.
<br>
Perhaps it is too much to ask for such.
<br>
The light you bring in me will remain vast.
<br>
It baffles me how you hold so much worth
<br>
Even so, I will welcome you like the shores.
<br>
<br>
The shores I believed to be out of reach,
<br>
Only to have my feet wet at the beach.
<br>
Quite luring you to walk in depths of dreams
<br>
Uttering that there are more than just whims.
